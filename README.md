- 👋 Hi, I’m @tickBit
- 👀 I’m interested in retro programming and some JS and Python related things... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter's Dart programming language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with friendly people, though my time is very limited to do these things...
- 📫 How to reach me ...perhaps I will find you! :-)
